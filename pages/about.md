# **About Me**

Hey, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:.<br> <br>
I am software developer working out from Pune, India. I am passionate about developing data driven systems.
Taking serious efforts to transition from a Full Stack Developer to a Data Engineer. I believe in TDD and the notion of
quality over quantity.

I am a proud engineer, and besides coding, I love to create anything and everything. I take particular interest in
reading about latest development in the field of electronics and gadgets.

Inspirational films make my day! Besides this a long day behind the wheel among twisties puts a smile on my face.
